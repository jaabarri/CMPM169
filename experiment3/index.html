			<h1>Experiment 3: Generative Methods</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The original code formed a visual sketch with random and ordered dots resembling circles and just moving and clicking the mouse a little</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I Played with some animations and got the circles to move a little, makes the circle look pretty cool like its spinning, and Started to play with the direction of the X and Y and sizing of the circle see what and how it works kind of </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I was able to play around with noise the background is a little weird and gray not really any purpose but there are two modes when you click the circles kinda draw infinitely or something and when you click again(once or twice not sure fully) it goes back to the regular circle what the original code kinda had but not really </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some Highs were that I got the shapes to move how I wanted and stuff like that animation change shapes etc. However when it came to the rest the animation constantly over drawing dots moved not how I wanted. I then used that as another high to incorporate it and kinda make it what it is now</li>
				</ul>
