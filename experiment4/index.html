			<h1>Experiment 4 - Images, Video, & Sound Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with the portion of code that used images as a way to distort the thing and played around with that</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>I combined it with the video camera to incorporate a very similar effect but based on what the camera was seeing.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I kept a majority the same just really playing around with the camera since that was where i wanted to focus the most on and even then was a struggle cause it wasn't always working</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Some highs for this particular project was the capture was working as it was intended</li>
					<li>I could not for the life of me get the video camera to like unfreeze after the click so i had to stop hiding the element and that was a struggle cause it looks weird in the static webpage</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
