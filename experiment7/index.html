			<h1>Experiment 7 - Data Visualization and Networks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The code I started with was the code from p5.js that had just an earth with some data taken from a csv file and just placed around the world. I played with it trying to see how the data was placed and manipulated</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>For this code I just went in and tried to manipulate the data presented touching severity of the earthquakes having them be a little different in color and from there trying to print out in someway to see the data being Visualized or played with by the user</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I started with a world that just moved endlessly and from there I added some user function allowing the user to control the project and from there I made it more understandable and then presented some of the data relevant to the earthquakes to the console</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Overall this was a pretty good project I do like how I was able to add to it and play with it a little. However very dissappointed I couldn't do more. I couldn't figure out the hover aspect fully so it is not 100% accurate to where the mouse is, and on top of that I didn't just want to push to the console the data I want it to like pop up in some way just a little but I could not do it.</li>
				</ul>
