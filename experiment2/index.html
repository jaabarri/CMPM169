			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>I started with a some code that made randome faces when press on the screen. I messed around with it tried to understand it and thats the conclusion i ended up with after playing with it</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>So i tried to do what we did in class where we created a lot of squares but with faces but i didn't wantto make it super duper complicated so i started with shapes. Then i tried combining the faces and it wasn't working and i left it at that</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I liked the way the shapes were drawn in the background so I removed a lot of the faces added a little animation for rotation, i tried to make every shape rotate individually failed miserable and kept it just a 1 direction rotation and speed for all the shapes</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some lows were, no faces generated at random all over the screen, no individual roation, no individual speed rotation. A high would be that it looks like the monster inc for me not the intention but I like it</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
