			<h1>Experiment 6 - Grammars and Text Art</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>The code I started with was the code from p5.js something with text that turned and stuff using images imported and using special keys to activate those images</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>From that code I was able to use L-systems to get the code to look very visually distinct I tried to use the same keys and make it more visually different by adding strokes opacity and background colors</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I just started to think of playing with the words changing colors and sizing and nothing crazying and from there I looked at the slides a few examples and started from there to just incorporate some cool things inside of the code</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Overall pretty good highs nothing much can be said L-systems was a little tricky but i think i got something pretty simple on the screen and overall pretty good project i like a lot</li>
				</ul>
